# This is the 1st draft of Holt Winter's Implementation
# The below program is an implementation of Holt Winter's Forecasting technique. The algorithm is a triple exponential smoothing to predict number of points
# Series is a variable which we used to store bandwidth values and contain 60 values which define the bandwidth of each minute in an hour
# Bandwidth_Prediction is the variable where predicted points are bring stored. We will be predicting 60 points in the future i.e., Bandwidth range for the next hour
# slen is the season length which is a requirement of a time series. In this implementation it will be chosen as 15 minutes i.e. 15 
# Values of aplha,beta and gamma are predicted using formula's given in report. 
# Value of alpha is 0.09, beta is 0.004 and gamma is 0.09
