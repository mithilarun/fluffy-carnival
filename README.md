Automatic Bandwidth Control
===========================

This project looks at the bandwidth usage per tenant on a public cloud and builds a usage pattern history, using the Holt-Winter's forecasting algorithm. This usage pattern can be used to automatically regulate allocated bandwidth of tenants using OpenVSwitch, or could be used in security applications where any malicious activity could be detected.
